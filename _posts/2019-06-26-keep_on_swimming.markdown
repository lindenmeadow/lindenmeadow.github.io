Here I am, almost at the 2 month mark and a quarter of the way through the lessons in the full stack web development program. My goal has been to finish Flatiron in no more than a year, and hopefully in less time. Becoming gainfully employed in this field as soon as I can keeps driving me on! 

My greatest challenges thus far? Well, sometimes I feel like I'm suffering from an acute case of information overload, with so many details being thrown at me in such a short amount of time. And though I would consider myself a lifelong learner and good at learning new things, it's still a lot to absorb. Occasionally I would get frustrated with one of the labs too, but I eventually learned to Google things when I felt hopelessly stumped. (And in fact, it's been suggested to me that Flatiron is probably trying to get its students used to searching for solutions to coding challenges, as even professional developers often have to do that as well.)

But perhaps my biggest challenge of all is... distractions. Part of my problem stems from struggles with Attention Deficit Disorder, something that I've dealt with for years but was officially diagnosed with only recently. My mind sometimes behaves like a bucking bronco, fighting against me to have its own way. There are also distractions in the form of social media, TV, web surfing, etc. During the past week or two, I've let these distractions get the better of me and keep me from making much headway in this course. 

I'm getting back into my groove, more or less. Just like Dory kept singing in "Finding Nemo": "Keep on swimming, keep on swimming..."
