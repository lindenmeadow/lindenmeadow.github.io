Ah, the light at the end of the tunnel! The finish line in sight! After spending nearly a year and a half slogging through the jungles of coding bootcamp, I've nearly hacked my way out. Yes, I'm at the final project, and I'm crossing my fingers and kissinng my lucky rabbit's foot in the hopes that it will be accepted and I can finally bring this arduous trek to a close and find gainful employment in this field.

For my React-Redux project, I've made an app called Book Safari, which would enable users to look for book information via a search tool (powered by Google Books API) and create a log of their readings. The project is still somewhat in the rough -- I'm still working out some kinks in the book log update and delete functions, and I would like to improve on the overall styling -- but it's a functional CRUD app with a React-Redux frontend and a Rails API backend. The intended users would be students (mainly elementary school and/or middle school age) who are completing assigned reading for school. In some respects, it's based on my last project which would likewise enable students to create a log of their reading, something inspired by "The 40 Book Challenge". 

Due to some setbacks, mainly caused by some family crises, my work on the course has progresed much more slowly than I had anticipated. Frankly, I'm cutting things dangerously close to meeting the final deadline to finish everything. So hopefully, my covers all the bases for this assignment. Thank heaven for the online 'open office hours' for those of us who need feedback. I'll definitely be making use of them! Wish me luck!
