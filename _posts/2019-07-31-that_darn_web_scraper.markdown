Here I am, nearly 3 months into Flatiron's web developer program. On the upside, I've completed 200 lessons and 101 labs, and I've nearly finished the section on Ruby.  On the downside, I've gotten bogged down with the CLI Data Gem project. 

When I first looked at the project instructions, I felt overwhelmed. It seemed like we were being asked to do a too many complex tasks at once. To make matters worse, life decided to throw some curve balls at me, including a medical emergency in the family and anxieties over the plight of my aging parents. Yet I'm determined to see this through.

I've narrowed my project idea down to a program that would scrape the parish finder page on the Diocese of Raleigh's web site. What I'd like is for users to be able to search for parishes by city or county. The search would display the name(s) and phone number(s) of any parishes in the city or county they entered. (If they searched by city, it would also display the county, and if they searched by county, it would also show city or cities.) In addition, it would display the deanery. If there are no Catholic parishes in the city or county they entered, they will getting a message informing them of that. Thus, each parish will have five attributes: name, city, county, phone number, and deanery.

In addition to the two hour-long videos about this project that Flatiron provides on the curriculum site, I have been checking out other Ruby web scraper tutorials on YouTube. Hopefully they'll prove helpful. I'm still trying to hammer out my ideas for the classes and methods, butI have scheduled to speak with a Flatiron adviser in a couple of days about this. 

I'm still feeling ambivalent about the Ruby programming language. As I've noted before, I'd actually prefer to be studying Python. But who knows? Maybe after finishing that darn web scraper project, Ruby will start growing on me. Then, it's on to SQL...
