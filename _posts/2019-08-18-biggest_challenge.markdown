     I came to Flatiron via Career Karma. While doing their "21 Day Challenge", I would have to contact at least 2 new people each day as a way of getting to know other people who, like me, were exploring coding bootcamps, as well as those who had already completed a bootcamp and were employed in the field. Now that I have completed the 21 Day Challenge and have been doing Flatiron's program, I occasionally get contacted by folks doing the Challenge themselves and want to ask me about my experiences so far with Flatiron. 
		 A time or two I have been asked what my biggest challenge has been with the program. At first, I wasn't sure how to respond. Was it the process of learning how to code? Was it getting help when needed? Was it Flatiron's learning materials and format? Or was it more personal, such as self-discipline or balancing learning with other responsibilities?
		 A little over 3 months into the program, I would have to say my biggest challenge would fall in the latter category. Aside from my occasional frustration with a particular Ruby lesson or lab, I've struggled most with just staying the course. I have a part-time job, but the commute and irregular hours sometimes make it hard to keep a consistent learning schedule. In addition, other responsibilities -- such as helping my aging parents -- have at times interfered with my being able to get coding lessons done. I also have struggled for years with anxiety and ADD, both of which can derail my concentration and mental clarity. 
		 Though I've completed over 200 lessons so far and have nearly finished the section on Ruby, my Flatiron studies have stalled in recent weeks, mainly on the Ruby CLI Data Gem project. But I've managed to make some headway on it, and I expect to have it done before the week is out. 
		 So my 21 Day Challenge with Career Karma was just the first step in my greater challenge of finally getting into the field of web development. Wish me luck! And for those of you feeling discouraged, just know that you're not alone and that you *can* make it!
