Prior to beginning Flatiron's bootcamp, I had never studied Ruby. HTML? Check. CSS? Check. JavaScript? Check. I even took a course in Python. Then I began the full stack web development program and was introduced to Yukihiro Matsumoto's brainchild: Ruby. In fact, about the first third of the program focuses pretty much exclusively on Ruby. 

My feelings thus far? Frankly, I wish the program focused instead of Python. Granted, it would have been easier for me since I already have experience with that language, but that's not the only reason. Based on my own experiences with Ruby and Python, as well as what I've read about them, Python is definitely easier to learn. Furthermore, Ruby has declined in popularity, whereas Python's popularity is on the rise. 

I'll admit that an additional issue may lie with the way Ruby has been presented in the program. In previous blog posts, I've remarked that a pet peeve of mine is how the lessons often don't adequately prepare us to do some of the coding exercises (a.k.a. "labs"), either because the instructions are too vague or they require us to do things that are really beyond the scope of what the lessons have covered. On multiple occasions, I would have to Google solutions for the labs because I simply couldn't figure out how to do them on my own. And then as I looked over the code in the solutions, I would see things that I had never come across before or that the lessons had barely touched on. 

On the upside, I understand that Ruby seems to be an excellent language for web applications, and some companies use it extensively. So I'm left wondering whether I'll stick with Ruby once I finish Flatiron's program or try returning to Python.
