Well, it's been approximately one month since I ventured into the realm of Flatiron. So, how have I fared thus far in this new world of coding? Overall, things are progressig well. Newbies like me in the self-paced online program are advised to try to complete 100 lessons in the first 28 days, and I'm pleased to report that I have managed not only to meet that goal but to surpass it, bolstering my confidence that I'll be able to finish the program in no more than a year, if not less. 

Having already taken some courses in web development and programming, I've breezed through a number of the lessons. However, I've also had my share of frustrating moments. Frankly, some of the lessons, in my humble opinion, don't provide sufficiently clear instructions about how to complete the labs we're required to do, and sometimes I feel the labs require us to preform tasks that are simply beyond the scope of what we have studied so far. 

For instance, the lab on regular expressions provided scanty information and didn't even cover a few of the things the lesson's introduction had said would be covered. So when I got to the lab portion of the section, I felt unprepared to do some parts of it and had to end up searching online for solutions. Likewise, for the life of me I couldn't figure out on my own how to complete the hash iteration lab and had to scour Google for a way to complete it. In both instances, it wasn't that I couldn't understand the material presented in the lessons but that the information they provided was inadequate. In these and one or two other instances, I was left scratching my head and wondering how in the world I was supposed to have known how to complete the assignment. Mind you, I have a master's degree and also made straight A's in other web development courses I have taken, so it's not that I'm too dense to learn new things or to do tasks requiring critical thinking skills. Rather, I feel some of the curriculum I've encountered so far needs improvement. 

But for the most part, I've enjoyed Flatiron's program and look forward to expanding my knowledge of web development. And hopefully (fingers crossed!), I'll be gainfully employed before another year has gone by!
